# Sliding-Window
Scripts that reproduce behaviour of sliding windows

In order to run, open 2 terminals

- The first will be our server, where you can run the script *server_<FOLDER_NAME>.py*

- The second will be the client, where you can run the script *client_<FOLDER_NAME>.py*

NOTE: First run the server then the client, if you don't follow this it won't work
